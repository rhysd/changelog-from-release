# [v3.5.2](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v3.5.2) - 05 Jan 2023

- Check and follow redirects for Git remote URLs. This check is necessary to resolve renamed old repositories correctly. ([#16](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/issues/16))
- Avoid unnecessary memory allocation when no reference link is included in changelog.
- Update dependencies to include `golang.org/x/*` packages which were newly managed as Go modules.

# [v3.5.1](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v3.5.1) - 12 Dec 2022

- Add `-d` option to include/exclude drafts in generated changelog. (thanks [@paescuj](https://github.com/paescuj), [#15](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/issues/15))
  ```sh
  # Exclude drafts from the output
  changelog-from-release -d=false > CHANGELOG.md
  ```
- Include version of `changelog-from-release` in the footer of generated output
- Remove a single space which were prepended to a footer line
- Do not fail when no release is found since an empty changelog is a good start point of development

<a name="v3.4.0"></a>
# [v3.4.0](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v3.4.0) - 27 Aug 2022

- Add `-i` option to ignore release tags by regular expression pattern. For example, if your project has `nightly` tag release for nightly builds, it can be excluded as follows:
  ```sh
  changelog-from-release -i '^nightly$' > CHANGELOG.md
  ```
- Add `-e` option to extract release tags by regular expression pattern. For example, if your project uses `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}` format for release tags, they can be extracted as follows:
  ```sh
  changelog-from-release -e '^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$' > CHANGELOG.md
  ```
- Allow multiple drafts in releases. For including draft releases, see [the FAQ](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release#how-to-update-changelog-before-adding-the-release-tag) for more details.

<a name="v3.3.0"></a>
# [v3.3.0](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v3.3.0) - 23 Aug 2022

- Add `args` input to [the action](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/tree/master/action) to define command line arguments passed to `changelog-from-release` command.
  ```yaml
  - uses: rhysd/changelog-from-release/action@v3
    with:
      file: CHANGELOG.md
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      # Pass `-l 2` to use `##` instead of `#` for each release section
      args: -l 2
  ```
- Add `header` and `footer` inputs to [the action](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/tree/master/action) to insert templates before/after the generated changelog. The following step inserts the header and the footer.
  ```yaml
  - uses: rhysd/changelog-from-release/action@v3
    with:
      file: CHANGELOG.md
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      args: -l 2
      header: |
        Changelog
        =========

        This is header.
      footer: |-

        This is footer.
  ```
- Report an error when the release is not associated with any Git tags. This can happen when the release is a draft.
- Fix release date is broken when the release is a draft. Instead of published date, created date is used in the case.
- Add [FAQ section](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release#faq) to readme document. Currently two topics are described.
  - [How to update changelog before adding the release tag?](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release#how-to-update-changelog-before-adding-the-release-tag)
  - [How to insert some templates at top/bottom of generated changelog?](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release#how-to-insert-some-templates-at-topbottom-of-generated-changelog)

[Changes][v3.3.0]


<a name="v3.2.0"></a>
# [v3.2.0](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v3.2.0) - 22 Aug 2022

- Add `-l` option to set heading level of each release sections. For example, `-l 2` uses `##` instead of `#` for each release sections.
- Use Go 1.19 to build release binaries.
- Go module path was changed from `github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release` to `github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/v3` since `go install` without version specifier does not work in recent Go toolchain. ([#14](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/issues/14))

[Changes][v3.2.0]


<a name="v3.1.4"></a>
# [v3.1.4](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v3.1.4) - 10 Aug 2022

- In previous release, references in link texts were fixed. But the fix was not perfect. Nested text node in a link node was still linked incorrectly and this release fixed the bug. For instance, `@foo` in `[_@foo_](...)` should not be linked where the text is in italic node in link node.

[Changes][v3.1.4]


<a name="v3.1.3"></a>
# [v3.1.3](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v3.1.3) - 08 Aug 2022

- Do not references in link texts. Previously references in link texts like `[#1](...)` were linked to `[[#1](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/1)](...)`. Now they are not linked and left as-is ([#12](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/issues/12)).


[Changes][v3.1.3]


<a name="v3.1.2"></a>
# [v3.1.2](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v3.1.2) - 04 Aug 2022

- Fixed `commit-summary-template` was not effective by renaming the input to `commit_summary_template`. Hyphens are not available in Docker actions. For example, when `v1.2.3` is released, the following step creates a commit with summary `chore(changelog): describe changes for "v1.2.3"`.
  ```yaml
  - uses: rhysd/changelog-from-release/action@v3
    with:
      file: CHANGELOG.md
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      commit_summary_template: 'chore(changelog): describe changes for %s'
  ```

[Changes][v3.1.2]


<a name="v3.1.1"></a>
# [v3.1.1](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v3.1.1) - 04 Aug 2022

- Use `git remote` instead of `git rev-parse` to retrieve a remote name of repository since `git rev-parse` sometimes returns an unexpected output for some reason. ([#6](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/issues/6))
- Added `commit-summary-template` input to [the action](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/tree/master/action) so that the commit message can be customized. The template is passed to the first argument of `printf` command. It must contain one `%s` placeholder which will be replaced with the tag name.
- Removed duplicate of command output from error messages on `git` command failure.
- Improved error messages when retrieving a URL of remote repository

[Changes][v3.1.1]


<a name="v3.1.0"></a>
# [v3.1.0](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v3.1.0) - 03 Aug 2022

- Link commit references in release note automatically. For example, `85a7d9028ed70bc81224cb126e29e070dcc0aa1c` is converted to ``[`85a7d9028e`](https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/85a7d9028ed70bc81224cb126e29e070dcc0aa1c)``. Note that only full-length (40 characters) commit hashes are linked to avoid false positives.
- Fix user references followed by `/` like `@foo/` are wrongly linked.
- Describe how reference auto linking works in [README.md](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/blob/master/README.md).

[Changes][v3.1.0]


<a name="v3.0.0"></a>
# [v3.0.0](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v3.0.0) - 03 Aug 2022

- **BREAKING:** Labels at head of list items are no longer converted to bold text. For example, a list item starting with `- Fix:` was converted to `- **Fix:**`, but it is no longer converted from v3.0.0.
- Issue references like `#123` and user references like `@rhysd` are now automatically linked ([#3](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/issues/3)). For example, when we have a release item as follows in release notes:
  ```markdown
  - Fixed something (thanks @rhysd, #1)
  ```
  `changelog-from-release` links the references as follows:
  ```markdown
  - Fixed something (thanks [@rhysd](https://github.com/rhysd), [#1](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/1))
  ```
- Fixed `git@` and `ssh://` repository URLs were not converted to HTTPS URLs when the repository is hosted on GHE.
- Updated `google/go-github` dependency from v17 to v45.
- Removed `pkg/errors` dependency and used standard `fmt.Errorf` instead.

<a name="v2.2.5"></a>
# [v2.2.5](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v2.2.5) - 02 Jun 2022

- Fix `changelog-from-release` command hangs when generating a changelog of repository which has more than 30 releases ([#8](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/issues/8), [#10](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/issues/10))

[Changes][v2.2.5]


<a name="v2.2.4"></a>
# [v2.2.4](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v2.2.4) - 12 May 2022

- Strip credentials in repository URLs ([#9](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/issues/9)).
- Fix [the action](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/tree/master/action) fails due to permission error on accessing a workspace directory.
- Update dependencies in `go.mod`.
- Use [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to make release binaries.

[Changes][v2.2.4]


<a name="v2.2.3"></a>
# [v2.2.3](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v2.2.3) - 26 Sep 2021

- Improve: Introduce Go modules. Now this tool is installable via `go install`
- Improve: Better footer comment (thanks [@spl](https://github.com/spl), [#7](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/issues/7))
- Improve: Build binaries with the latest Go toolchain v1.17
- Improve: Release `darwin/arm64` and `linux/arm64` binaries

[Changes][v2.2.3]


<a name="v2.2.2"></a>
# [v2.2.2](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v2.2.2) - 24 Feb 2021

- Fix: Rename `github-token` input to `github_token` since `-` is not available for input names ([#4](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/issues/4))

[Changes][v2.2.2]


<a name="v2.2.0"></a>
# [v2.2.0](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v2.2.0) - 22 Feb 2020

- New: Support `$GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` environment variable to configure API endpoint for GitHub Enterprise

```sh
export GITHUB_API_BASE_URL=https://github.your-company.com/api/v3
GITHUB_TOKEN=abcabcabcabcabcabcabc changelog-from-release > CHANGELOG.md
```

<a name="v2.1.0"></a>
# [v2.1.0](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v2.1.0) - 20 Feb 2020

- New: [Action](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/tree/master/action) for [GitHub Actions]() was added. Updating your changelog file following the new release now can be automated easily.

Example workflow:

```yaml
name: Update changelog
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  changelog:
    name: Update changelog
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: master
      - uses: rhysd/changelog-from-release/action@v2
        with:
          file: CHANGELOG.md
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

<a name="v2.0.0"></a>
# [v2.0.0](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release/releases/tag/v2.0.0) - 19 Feb 2020

I decided to keep this tool as simple as possible. This release drops some features for simplification.

- Breaking: Instead of modifying `CHANGELOG.md`, this tool outputs a generated changelog to stdout. Please redirect the output to update your changelog file

```
$ changelog-from-release > CHANGELOG.md
```

- Breaking: Drop `-commit` flag. Please add and commit changes by yourself

```
$ changelog-from-release > CHANGELOG.md
$ git add CHANGELOG.md
$ git commit -m "Update changelog for $(git describe --tags)"
```
